# Ideas

- More UnitTests
- Shared domain models in Common.DomainModels should be separated
- ValueObjects for CardNumber and PaymentAmount should have more domain-specific logic
- Strongly typed Guids
- Better error handling in controllers
- Encryption of API keys and sensitive data inside events
- Custom contentTypes for merchant endpoint
- ELK stack for metrics and logs
- Save stringified statuses
